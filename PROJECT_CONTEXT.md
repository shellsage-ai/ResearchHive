# Project Context: ResearchHive

## Purpose
Build a Windows-native, agentic research assistant that:
- Runs long-duration online research jobs from a prompt (plan → browse → snapshot → extract → index → synthesize → iterate)
- Stores everything in **session-scoped workspaces** (subjects) with reproducible citations
- Supports a **Discovery Studio** that generates and refines novel ideas (materials/maker, chemistry-safe, history, philosophy, math, programming research, etc.)
- Provides domain-aware tools (capability packs) so each subject feels “pro” for its domain
- Produces clean reports and “learning trails” users can revisit

## Core promise
“Give it a research goal, let it run, then open a readable report with receipts you can click.”

## Principles
- Evidence over vibes
- Capture once, cite forever
- Session isolation by default
- Transparent logs: what happened and why
- Safety/IP marking for relevant domains
