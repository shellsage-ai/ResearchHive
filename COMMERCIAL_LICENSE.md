## FAQ

**Q: Can I use ResearchHive for personal research and publish the *findings*?**
A: Yes. The license covers the *software*, not the research outputs you create with it. Publishing your own research findings is fine. The restriction is on redistributing or commercializing the *software itself* or derivatives of it.

**Q: I'm a student / academic researcher. Do I need a license?**
A: No. Educational and public research use is explicitly permitted under the noncommercial license.

**Q: Can I try it out to evaluate whether I want a commercial license?**
A: Absolutely. Evaluation is a noncommercial use.

**Q: I run an open-source project. Can I use ResearchHive?**
A: If your project is noncommercial, yes. If your project is part of a commercial product or service, you need a commercial license.
