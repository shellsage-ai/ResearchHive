You are an implementation agent with full write access to this repository. Your task is to build the ENTIRE Windows application described by the spec files in this repo.

ABSOLUTE RULE: Complete the full project end-to-end and only stop when everything is done. You may implement in internal milestones, but you must NOT ask me to approve milestones or come back for permission. If a detail is ambiguous, choose a reasonable default, record it in PROJECT_PROGRESS.md under Assumptions Log, and proceed.

CRITICAL PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS (do not skip):
- Agentic browsing must be implemented as an iterative loop: plan → search (multi-lane) → snapshot → extract/index → evaluate coverage/contradictions → refine queries → repeat.
- The system must explicitly seek diverse viewpoints and produce outputs with BOTH:
  - “Most Supported View” (evidence-weighted), and
  - “Credible Alternatives / Broader Views”.
- The system must enforce polite browsing rules (do not hammer sites) per spec/SEARCH_LANES_AND_COURTESY.md:
  - max 1 concurrent fetch per domain
  - delays with jitter between requests to same domain
  - exponential backoff on 429/503/timeouts and circuit-break repeated failures
  - caching/dedupe: do not refetch if snapshot already exists (unless user forces refresh)
  - do not bypass paywalls/logins/anti-bot protections; if blocked, log and move to alternatives

Read and follow these specs (in order):
- RUNBOOK.md
- PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
- spec/AUTONOMOUS_EXECUTION.md
- spec/PRODUCT_BRIEF.md
- spec/SCOPE_NON_GOALS.md
- spec/ARCHITECTURE.md
- spec/DOMAIN_CAPABILITY_PACKS.md
- spec/SEARCH_LANES_AND_COURTESY.md
- spec/SESSION_WORKSPACE_SPEC.md
- spec/CITATIONS_AND_SNAPSHOTS.md
- spec/SAFETY_SYSTEM.md
- spec/PROGRAMMING_RESEARCH_AND_IP.md
- spec/MATERIALS_EXPLORER.md
- spec/IDEA_FUSION_ENGINE.md
- spec/REPORTING_AND_LEARNING.md
- spec/MODEL_STRATEGY.md
- spec/AUTOMATION_AND_TOOLS.md
- spec/DATA_MODEL.md
- spec/UI_WPF_SPEC.md
- spec/RESEARCH_AGENT_LOOP.md
- spec/IDEA_STUDIO.md
- spec/END_TO_END_DEMO.md
- spec/MILESTONE_PLAN.md

Then implement by executing spec/MILESTONE_PLAN.md Milestones 1–9 sequentially WITHOUT STOPPING.
- Keep the solution buildable at all times.
- No placeholders, no stubs, no TODO-only features.

At the end (and only at the end), provide:
- exact build/run commands
- confirmation you passed every item in spec/END_TO_END_DEMO.md
- where configuration lives (paths, models, providers)
- a short list of key assumptions

Begin now with Milestone 1 and continue automatically until Milestone 9 is complete.
