# Scope and Non-Goals

## In Scope (MVP)
- Sessions hub + per-session workspace
- Immutable artifact store (content-addressed)
- Inbox ingestion (PDF/md/txt/images) + OCR captures
- Web snapshots (Playwright) with offline reproducibility
- Hybrid retrieval (keyword + semantic) with evidence panel
- Agentic long-running jobs with checkpointing + pause/resume + restart recovery
- Citation-enforced answers + click-to-open evidence highlights
- Discovery Studio (ideas + novelty sanity-check + scoring)
- Materials Explorer (property→candidates + filters + safety marking)
- Programming Research + IP Studio (approach matrix + IP summary + design-around)
- Idea Fusion (combine research with provenance)
- Reports + learning replay

## Not in MVP
- Cloud sync / multi-user collaboration
- Guaranteed global novelty proof
- Legal advice
- Step-by-step dangerous procedural instructions
- Running arbitrary downloaded code
