# Programming Research + IP Studio

## Purpose
Research software approaches like a senior engineer while avoiding infringement pitfalls.

## Required outputs
- Approach matrix with citations
- Recommended approach + rationale (cited)
- Implementation plan (original; no verbatim copying from external sources)
- IP/License summary:
  - sources used
  - license signals if present
  - uncertainty labeling
  - risk flags + why
  - lawful design-around options (standards/specs, permissive libs, first principles, clean-room plan)

## Rules
- Not legal advice; surface signals and safer paths.
- Prefer standards/specs and permissive sources for implementation guidance.
- Avoid reproducing large verbatim code from external sources.
