# Product Brief — ResearchHive

## What it is
A Windows desktop app that runs **agentic research + discovery** workflows with:
- Session/subject workspaces (separate knowledge per subject)
- Evidence capture (immutable web snapshots + local files + screenshot OCR)
- Hybrid search (keyword + semantic) per session
- Citation-enforced answers (click-to-open evidence)
- Domain capability packs (math/history/materials/programming/etc.)
- Readable reports + “learning replay” of what it did

## Primary Modes
1) Research (agentic): plan → gather evidence → synthesize with citations
2) Discovery Studio (agentic): generate ideas → novelty sanity-check → feasibility scoring → refine → export
3) Materials Explorer: properties→candidates + filters + safety labeling
4) Programming Research + IP Studio: engineering research + IP awareness + lawful design-arounds
5) Idea Fusion: combine research into new proposals with traceable provenance

## Safety + IP posture (critical)
- Physical-world topics: always mark PPE/environment/hazards/disposal and cite safety refs where possible.
- Programming research: surface licensing/copyright signals and propose lawful paths (standards-based, permissive substitutes, clean-room options).
- The system stays useful for research/ideation; when something becomes unsafe or infringing, it shifts to high-level guidance + safer alternatives and references.

## Success criteria
- Sessions hub with tags/search/status + last-report preview + replay.
- Long-running jobs survive restarts.
- Every substantive claim is cited to immutable evidence or labeled hypothesis.
- Programming Pack outputs approach matrix + IP summary + design-arounds.
- Fusion outputs include provenance mapping and safety/IP notes when relevant.


## Broader views requirement
Every research output must include both:
- a “Most Supported View” (evidence-weighted), and
- “Credible Alternatives / Broader Views” (with citations and evaluation).
