# Materials Explorer (Properties → Candidates + Filters)

## Goal
Given target properties and constraints, produce ranked candidate materials/compounds/additives with:
- fit rationale
- citations
- safety environment + PPE + hazards + disposal
- DIY feasibility notes
- “what to test” checklist

## Inputs
- property targets (mechanical/thermal/chemical/processing/electrical/surface)
- filters (safety, cost, categories, process, evidence quality, novelty strictness)
- include/avoid (elements/materials/hazards)

## Engine
Retrieval-driven synthesis from captured sources, with novelty sanity-check and hypothesis labeling.
