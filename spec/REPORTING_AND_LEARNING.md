# Reporting + Learning Replay

## Reports (MVP)
- Executive summary
- Full report
- Job activity report (“what it did”)
- Replay timeline (learning cards with deep links)

## Additions
- Relevant items panel (top sources/passages grouped by lane)
- Provenance map where feasible
- IP/License summary for programming/fusion when software inputs involved

## Readability
Reports must be easy to skim, and fully navigable via citations.
